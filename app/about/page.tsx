                Hey there! I’m glad you found your way to SiteDex. This is my little corner of the internet where I collect and share websites that truly stand out for their minimal and beautiful design. <br/>I’ve always loved websites that feel simple, clean, and easy to use—those that don’t overwhelm you with clutter but instead focus on delivering a smooth, thoughtful experience.

                SiteDex started as a personal inspiration board. Whenever I stumbled across a site that caught my eye, I’d save it to revisit later. Over time, I realized these sites deserved a place of their own—a curated space where anyone could explore them without having to dig through endless design galleries. That’s how SiteDex was born.

                <br/>I handpick every website featured here myself. Each one reflects a style or approach that I find inspiring, whether it’s a clever layout, subtle animations, or just a beautiful balance of colors and typography. If you’re a designer, developer, or simply someone who appreciates good design, I hope you’ll find this collection as inspiring as I do.
